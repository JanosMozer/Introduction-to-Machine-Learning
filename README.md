# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning

I don't quite remember all the decisions I made back then, and It might be a bit difficult to run the network because the libraries became out of sync by now. The first few blocks of code should resolve that.
I also used a tool called WandAI, which enables easy oversite on the training results.

Next to the python notebook, I also uploaded a screenshot of the model's performance.
